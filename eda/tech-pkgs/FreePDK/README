***** Quick Design Kit Usage Instructions *****

  1) Change the environment variable $PDK_DIR in the file
     $PDK_DIR/cdslib/setup/setup.csh to reflect the FreePDK
     installation path.
     
  2) Source your setup scripts for Cadence Virtuoso, Mentor Graphics
     Calibre, and Synopsys PyCell Studio.  

  3) Change to the directory where you want to start Virtuoso and
     source the file $PDK_DIR/cdslib/setup/setup.csh.  Note that
     this script copies all of the required user files (.cdsinit,
     cds.lib, and Calibre runset files) to the current working directory 
     if they do not already exist.

  4) Start Cadence Virtuoso ( % virtuoso &  for example )
