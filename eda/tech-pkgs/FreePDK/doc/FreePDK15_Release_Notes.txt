Release Notes for FreePDK15 1.0 (2014-07-22)
(Git Repository Commit 2014-07-22)

Included in this release:
 - Technology library and display resources for Cadence Virtuoso
     (Tested with Virtuoso 6.1.5 01/16/2012)
 - Calibre DRC rules (Tested with Calibre 2011.3_18.12)
 - P-Cells for the CiraNova/Synopsys PyCell
     (Tested with PyCell 4.2.5-L2 Jun 27 2008)

Planned for the next release:
 - HSPICE models
 - Calibre LVS and xRC rules

Issues with this release:
 - P-Cells are not ready for use.  One reason for the delay is that we 
   have not successfully compiled the technology library with Synopsys
   PyCell 2013.12.  We are not currently working on this issue due to 
   lack of resources and are instead focusing on LVS/xRC rules.  The P-Cells
   included with this kit are intended rather to illustrate the current
   status of the code and provide a starting point for someone to begin
   debugging.
 - Design rules are subject to change.  We are iterating with NanGate and
   Mentor Graphics on design rules and anticipate another release later
   this year.  A summary of the issues we are currently considering can
   found by running DRC on the SDFFRNQ_X1 cell from the NanGate 15nm Open
   Cell Library:

    Rule Name  Description                                     Result Count
    ---------  ---------------------------------------------   ------------
    ACT.5      Horizontal Spacing of ACT                                  2
    AIL2.3     Minimum spacing between AIL2 and GATE[A|B]                 2
    AIL2.5     Minimum vertical overlap of AIL1 and AIL2                 15
    AIL2.10    Vertical spacing of AIL2 and AIL1 on different net         9
    GIL.8      Minumum vertical spacing of GIL to AIL2                    4
    V0.9       Minimum space of V0 and GIL on different net              17
    M1.3       Maximum length of M1[A|B] for wires w/ min width 28nm      2
    M1.8,9     Minumum spacing of M1[A|B]                                 5
    M1.15,16   M1[A|B] minimum spacing to M1[B|A]                        16
    MINT.3     Maximum length of MINTn[A|B] for wires w/ min width 28nm   2

    Some of these violations may be fixed through further clarification of
    each rule and modification of the calibre rules.  Others may result in 
    small chances to rule values.
