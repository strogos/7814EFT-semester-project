=======================================


12/8/04 -- Initial files created.
These are the result of a TSI 41 run on
the SPICE netlist of the cell library.

The netlist included RC elements

Additional information added:
- footprints for buf and inv
- test-cell declarations
- area information

(OLD) Known Issues
- The TLATNCN* cells are not useable
- SDFFTRX* test_data wrong
- TLATSRX* is bad
- Manually changed library name from slow, fast, typical to "gscl090"
  in e.g. "library(slow) {"


HISTORY
2005/1/09 Async pins modified (cdavid)

2005/1/11 Corrected TLATNCN* cells (jgrad)
          Fixed minor typo "G" instead of "GN" for fast.lib and typical.lib

2005/1/12 Corrected TLATNC* cells (jgrad)
          Corrected TLATNTSCN* cells (jgrad)
          Corrected TLAT*SRX* cells (jgrad)
2005/2/1  Updated "area" fields (jgrad)

2005/3/22 Added 6 missing cells (jgrad)

2005/7/25 Updated .lib and .tlf files.  All cells should be useable,
though some were modified by hand.

2005/9/26 Output new .lib from Signalstorm that now include ecsm tables

2006/04/03  gsclib090_v2.3 version updates to timing/ files:
There are 5 corners.  Tools should use and support *.lib_ecsm files if 
possible, but *.lib (non-ecsm) files are also provided as a workaround.
In the past, *.alf files had been provided, but due to the size of both
*.alf and *.alf_ecsm for all 5 corners (>700Meg), these files are not 
currently being shipped with the CDK090.  If you need .alf files, then
file a PCR (family/product/prodlevel2 = INTERNAL/CDK090/GSCLIB090)

IMPORTANT!  The RCX procfile was recently corrected.  Therefore, the
standard cells still need to be re-extracted and then have SignalStorm
run again to update these timing files so they will be consistent with
the true process definition.  A future release is expected to have the
updated files, which should improve correlation to other RC extractors.

2006/06/06  gsclib090_v2.4 version updates to timing/ files:
Newly characterized using latest RCX procfile.
