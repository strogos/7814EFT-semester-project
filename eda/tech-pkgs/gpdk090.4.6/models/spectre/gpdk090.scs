* GPDK Corner Definitions
* This is an example file showing how to define corners
* using model files for individual components as the
* building blocks.

* TODO:
* - dcmatch and MC for all devices (also for diodes, res,..)
* - check iso model
* - mc for caps
* - bottom plate cap for MIM cap
* - Csub for BJT
* - Check mc & dcmatch for consistency
* - diode Rs & Cj seems to be large, Cj of BJT reduced acc. to be more realistic
