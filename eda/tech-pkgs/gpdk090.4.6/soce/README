gpdk090.basic.CapTbl - is a basic encounter cap table
gpdk090.extended.CapTbl - is an extended cap table created with a pcs file and the coyote field solver
gpdk090.lef.extended.CapTbl - is an extended cap table that also includes the lef file and runs with the coyote field solver

The cap tables take from about 5 min(basic) to 8 hours(extended) to run on a Intel 2.8GHz Linux workstation.

These were built as follows:

First, set up to use SOC52USR1_lnx86

generateCapTbl -ict ../fireIce/qx/gpdk090_9l.ict -output gpdk090.basic.CapTbl -basic

generateCapTbl -ict ../fireIce/qx/gpdk090_9l.ict -output gpdk090.extended.CapTbl 

generateCapTbl -ict ../fireIce/qx/gpdk090_9l.ict -output gpdk090.lef.extended.CapTbl -lef ../../gsclib090/lef/gpdk090_tech_9lm.lef
